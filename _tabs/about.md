# Hi, I am Gismet, an algorithm enthusiast

**Little facts:**

* I am studying Computer Science and will graduate this year. 
* For a short time, I had done Front-end development just to get my hands dirty with web development. 
* I am keen on Back-end development and the applications of theory if possible. 
* I fell in love with algorithms the first time I took the algorithms class. in my sophomore year. Algorithms engaged my interest. 
* I find theoretical side of Computer science really captivating.
* Although I spend most of my time researching theoretical Computer science, I have also a fervent interest in software engineering and computer architecture
* I wrote my first line of code in my freshman year, not knowing what I was doing 💻
* I love learning programming languages and their strengths and weaknesses. 
* I mainly stick to `C` and `C++`, although that quote from Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of `C++`, is a little scary 😀.
>“C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off.”  
* **My mantra: A problem a day keeps the boredom away!**
