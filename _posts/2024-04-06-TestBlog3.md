Given a string s of `'('` , `')'` and lowercase English characters.

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( `'('` or `')'`, in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:

- It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
- It can be written as `AB` (`A`concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are valid strings, or
- It can be written as `(A)`, where `A`is a valid string.
